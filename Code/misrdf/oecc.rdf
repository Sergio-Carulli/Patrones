<p>The US Congress is one of the three highest authorities, as well as the country&#8217;s main legislative body. Its powers are recorded in the US Constitution. The Congress consists of the lower and upper chambers, the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively. Sessions of Congress are held in Washington on Capitol Hill.<span id="more-22"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Two Houses of Congress</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The House of Representatives</strong> of the US Congress consists of 435 representatives participating in voting on the issues under discussion. Each of these representatives is elected to the lower House of the Congress in its own electoral district. Re-election of participants takes place once every two years. Armchairs in the House of Representatives are distributed between the states, depending on the population in each of them. Members of this chamber may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker, who is elected directly inside the House by a vote of its members. Members of the US House of Representatives are involved in passing federal laws, that is, those laws that apply to all states without exception. Bills adopted in the lower House go through the procedure of discussion in Congress and are sent to be signed by the President. Then they acquire the status of laws. Candidates for election to the US House of Representatives must be over 25 years old, be citizens of the United States and live in the state that they will represent for at least the past seven years;</li>
<li>
<strong>The Senate</strong> is composed of 100 members (senators), each of whom, works in the upper house of US parliament for 6 years. Senators are recruited for two people from each state. Initially, members of the Senate were elected by the members of the legislative assemblies formed in each state, but in 1913, the 17th Amendment to the United States Constitution came into effect, according to which the election of senators became direct. Senators are elected simultaneously with members of the House of Representatives. Since each member of the lower House of the US Congress is re-elected once every two years, and the term in the upper house is 6 years, then one-third of the Senate will be reelected on a rotating basis every two years. If during elections to the House of Representatives an electoral district is formed depending on the number of people, then the entire territory of the state becomes an electoral district when electing senators. People who have reached the age of 30 and reside for at least the last nine years in the state may be elected to the US Senate.</li>
</ol>
